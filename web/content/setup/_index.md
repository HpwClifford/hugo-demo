### Hugo

# Setup Guide

## I.) basic setup

Using the hugo cli, we can generate a new project directory within our existing project:

```sh
hugo new site web
```

Then, we'll select a theme and add it as a github submodule. Here's how I downloaded the theme for this site:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn web/themes/hugo-theme-learn
```

And that's it! We have the basic setup to build a hugo site. Let's get building!

Note: from here on out, all commands should be executed from the **web/** directory.

## II.) creating site content

We can use the hugo cli to start a local development server:

```sh
hugo server
```

This will default to serve our site at **https://localhost:1313/our-repo/**

```sh
Start building sites â€¦ 
hugo v0.100.2+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown

From here we can use hugo and our configured theme to build the site. Links:
