# About

**This is an example of a pretty basic hugo site using an open-source theme and statically deployed to github pages**

#### A few benefits:
- **living right in the repo could allow documentation to live next to code**
- **uses lightweight set-and-forget github actions workflow for build / deployment**
- **git and markdown make further additions simple**
- **auth can be configured to only people with repo access via github**
- **it's free!**
